⚙️ Methodology
Data Collection: Acquired GSR data from satellite and meteorological sources.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned missing values, normalized the data, and performed feature selection.

Model Development: Trained and tested multiple ML models to predict GSR.

Model Evaluation: Compared performance using RMSE, MAE, and R² metrics.

Deployment (optional): Prepared for integration into solar energy management platforms.
